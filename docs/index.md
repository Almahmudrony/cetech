# What is it?

CETech is a Data-Driven game engine and toolset designed for develolp games and other interactive applications.
They are trying to be free, small, easily expandable and multiplatform (yes, typical bullshit = D).
Not trying to be a pummeling functions and does not allow you a few clicks to create professional look game
like Unreal Engine, Unity etc... But instead will provide a good basis for further work.

    CETech is under havy development and now is only prototype.
    First i need make simple and well tested public api, resource data format, usable playground ecosystem and than optimize engine for speed and size.

### Who is it for?

For anyone who wants to make games or interactive applications, not afraid to learn new things and do not want to write
from technology scratch.

### What does it consist?

The main part is the [**engine**][engine], development environment [**Playground**][playground] and a set of python
scripts to facilitate the compilation and managing dependencies.
